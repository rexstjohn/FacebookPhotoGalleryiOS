Facebook has a neat photo gallery in their mobile app.

If you haven’t seen it, when you tap a photo you get a modal dialog and you can swipe images back and forth as well as pinch to zoom. Replicating this effect is a much larger pain than one might anticipate, especially in the world of AutoLayout where a misplaced constraint can ruin the whole thing.

Here is a working implementation, feel free to use it for your own purposes. It also handles device rotations gracefully.
Uses a scroll view with an image. Should work on both iPhone and iPad.

Make sure you have Cocoapods and run “pod install.”  When you run it, things should work properly.
